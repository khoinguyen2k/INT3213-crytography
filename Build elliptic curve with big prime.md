## Eng
 + Method 1: OB2551 has already implemented SEA algorithm, which is used to find number of points of an alliptic curve
	 + Link: https://github.com/OB2551/SEA_Schoof_algorithm
	 + I left my note in [Issues](https://github.com/OB2551/SEA_Schoof_algorithm/issues) to fix some small bugs
 + Method 2: Use PARI/GP
	 + Download PARI/GP at: http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/download.html
	 + Open PARI/GP and run file "elliptic.gp"
